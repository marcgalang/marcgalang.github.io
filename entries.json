Therefore a first draft blog entry is way below what I'm comfortable with sharing, and there just are not enough minutes in a day to do the edits I want to do. That being said, here are my ramblings.)<br><br>The day had its share of introductions. Not just of the instructor and my cohorts but introductions to a number of tools such as Notebook++ and Everything (which I'll throw onto my pc as soon as I get home). We each got to boot a machine and play around with these tools. We also set up accounts with various services including but not limited to gmail, google voice, dropbox, stack overflow, Github, and twitter. Much of the morning, while still exploratory, was largely clerical as the accounts were squared away. The fun began when we played with the code for a twitter bot. There were really only a few lines of code, but it was enough to tweet phrases out of a text file. It's one thing to write code that outputs \"Hello, world,\" to a screen but it's more fun to actually work on something that sends out messages to the entire world (of twitter, at least). We then jumped into git, where our code will live. "

That being said, here are my ramblings.)<br><br>Although we played with code yesterday, today is the first day we were officially learning what we are doing from the ground up: what is a variable, what is a boolean, etc. We looked at lists and how to manipulate them. There is enough information that may be considered basic to make me feel comfortable but there's still enough that I have to google to find the correct command or the correct syntax. The interesting part of the day is when we played a simple dice game with physical dice, making up and modifying the rules of the game as we went. Based on what we learned the first day (and with the help of prior knowledge, google, and stack overflow) we were to code a version of the game. Even with varying prior coding experience I think that each pair of students is up to the challenge. We're able to help each other as we go, reinforcing things we may have just learned.<br><br>Regular breaks away from the workstations are strongly encouraged, which is difficult with me-- although I appreciate a break when stuck I'd like to keep going when I think I have a flow."

That being said, here are my ramblings.)<br><br>Most of us didn't finish the lab from yesterday, so we started the day on that. The lab involved exploring string/list manipulation. I personally spent a lot of time trying to figure out the best way to test if an object exists in two different lists. Logically, it is the intersection of the two sets, but it seems like not only is there not a pre-made function (method? operation?), but according to the internets the best way to do this is with sets, a subject I would be happy to delve into when the need becomes, well, overwhelming... It's not that I don't want to learn something new (that is why I'm here, after all), but I think it best to take in my knowledge in categorized chunks, and something like sets does not fit into any of the chunks I'm currently nibbling on.<br><br>The second half of the day was spent on coding as a group. There were certainly pluses and minuses to this, as I'm sure was part of the point. The exercise gave us the opportunity to work together and share ideas. It allowed people to ask questions and see multiple solutions to a problem. It also showed that multiple solutions can each be valid, but they are not necessarily valid together. But we also got to an end of sorts, which I'd consider a success."
